All notable changes to chatwire are documented here.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.12.0] - 2026-05-10

### Added
- **Scoped API keys** (#26): Multiple named API keys with per-key permission
  scopes (`trigger_actions`, `read_conversations`, `send_messages`,
  `manage_settings`). Keys use the `cwk_` prefix + 32 hex chars and are
  stored PBKDF2-SHA256-hashed in `~/.chatwire/api_keys.json` (chmod 600).
  Authenticate via `Authorization: Bearer cwk_<key>`.
  Settings UI: create / delete / copy keys with scope checkboxes.
- **Mark all read** (#19): "Mark all read" button in the sidebar clears all
  unread badges; also calls `navigator.clearAppBadge()` on supported
  browsers (PWA / Android). Keyboard shortcut `Shift+Escape` works from
  anywhere in the app.
- **Appearance quick-link** (#10): Sidebar footer now has an "Appearance"
  link that navigates to `/settings#appearance` and auto-opens the
  Appearance accordion section.
- **Hash-driven settings accordion** (#9): `SettingsPage` reads the URL
  hash on mount and on hash changes to open the matching section and
  scroll it into view — enables deep-linking to any settings section.

### Changed
- `web/main.py` auth gate: Bearer token path added before cookie path —
  `Authorization: Bearer cwk_…` header is validated against the API key
  store and the required scope is checked against the route map before
  falling through to cookie auth.

## [1.11.0] - 2026-05-10

### Changed
- MediaGallery lightbox migrated from raw `@radix-ui/react-dialog` to the
  shadcn `Dialog` wrapper (`Dialog`, `DialogPortal`, `DialogOverlay`,
  `DialogClose`, `DialogTitle` from `@/components/ui/dialog`).
  Visually-hidden `DialogTitle` added for screen-reader accessibility.

### Added
- Lightbox keyboard navigation: `ArrowLeft` / `ArrowRight` keys step through
  images; `Escape` closes (handled by Radix).
- 14 Vitest unit tests for `MediaGallery` covering gallery grid rendering
  (1 / 2 / 4 / 5+ images, overflow badge) and full lightbox interaction
  (open, close, prev/next buttons, arrow-key navigation, boundary clamping).
  Total Vitest count: 84 (was 70).

## [1.10.0] - 2026-05-09

### Added
- Sign out link in the SettingsPage footer — `<a href="/logout">Sign out</a>` (Option H).

### Removed
- `POST /api/auth/password` endpoint and `_render_password_card()` helper removed from
  `web/main.py` (htmx-era dead code, superseded by `POST /api/ui/settings/password` in v1.8.0).
- `web/templates/_login.html` and `web/templates/_password_card.html` deleted
  (replaced by React LoginPage and PasswordSection respectively).

## [1.9.0] - 2026-05-09

### Added
- React login page at `/app/login` — replaces the Jinja2 `_login.html`
  template. New JSON endpoint `POST /api/ui/auth/login` (public path, no
  cookie required) verifies the password, sets the session cookie, and
  returns `{"ok": true, "next": "<url>"}`. Same rate-limit bucket as the
  old `/login` form. The auth-gate middleware now redirects unauthenticated
  requests to `/app/login`; `/logout` redirects there too.

### Changed
- `web/auth.py`: `_PUBLIC_PREFIXES` now includes `/app/assets/` so the
  React SPA JavaScript and CSS load correctly for unauthenticated users
  (required for the login page to render). `/app/login` added to
  `_PUBLIC_PATHS`.

### Removed
- Jinja2 `GET /login` and `POST /login` route handlers removed from
  `web/main.py`. The `_login.html` template remains on disk but is no
  longer served.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-05-09

### Added
- React Settings — Password section: set, change, or remove the web UI
  password directly from the Settings page without touching config files.
  New JSON endpoints `GET /api/ui/settings/password` (auth status) and
  `POST /api/ui/settings/password` (set / change / clear). Same rate-limit
  and current-password verification as the existing login route. On
  password change the response issues a fresh session cookie so the user
  stays logged in.

### Changed
- Legacy Jinja2/htmx UI removed (Option D — Chunk 19). React SPA at
  `/app/` is now the only UI; `GET /` always redirects to `/app/`.
  `POST /whitelist/add`, `POST /whitelist/remove`, `POST /refresh_contacts`
  now return JSON (`{"ok": true}`) instead of HTML fragments.
  `POST /whitelist/remove` now accepts the `input` field that the React
  SettingsPage sends (previously a silent no-op due to field name mismatch).
